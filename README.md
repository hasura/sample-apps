# Sample Apps with Hasura GraphQL

This directory contains community-contributed code and content that supplements Hasura GraphQL Engine. It includes several example applications built using GraphQL Engine to demonstrate its features, several boilerplates for users to get started with any popular frontend framework of choice. 

Details on how to deploy and/or modify the code is specified in various READMEs.

**NOTE**: Many of the sample apps were updated a long time ago. It should work with those versions of the frameworks used. But we are working on improving the list here to be more up to date with both the app and the Hasura version used.
